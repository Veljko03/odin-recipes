    <h2>Easy Moussaka Recipe: This Middle Eastern Casserole Recipe Is Heavenly</h2>
    <p><strong>Moussaka is a savory casserole dish with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern origins</strong>. Moussaka is made with a ground meat, <em>eggplant</em> (sometimes potato) with a <em>creamy béchamel sauce</em>. The star of moussaka is usually <em>eggplant</em> (aubergines), and ground lamb is most often used, though many cooks do use ground beef. This creamy casserole recipe is popular in Greece and Turkey, and in the Balkans.</p>
    <p>This easy moussaka recipe starts by broiling slices of <em>eggplant</em> until soft and golden. A meat sauce is then prepared using onion, ground <em>lamb</em> or <em>beef</em>, oregano, cinnamon, nutmeg, paprika, red wine, canned diced tomatoes, a little sugar and beef broth. The simple béchamel sauce is a creamy combination of olive oil, flour, nutmeg and eggs. The ingredients are layered in a casserole dish and baked to perfection.</p>

    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggplant, ends trimmed and sliced lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound ground lamb or ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red wine</li>
        <li>1 can (14 ounces) diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
        <p>Béchamel Sauce</p>
        <li>1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2/3 cup flour</li>
        <li>dash of nutmeg</li>
        <li>4 cups milk, warm</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Here's how to make it: </strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the eggplant into a colander and sprinkle with salt. Let it sit for about 30 minutes. Dry the eggplant with paper towels and then layer them onto an oiled baking sheet in a single layer. Brush with olive oil. Broil the eggplant until soft and golden. Remove and set aside. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>To make the meat sauce, heat a little olive oil in a skillet. Add the onions and cook until soft and turning golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the ground meat and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Drain excess fat. Add the oregano, cinnamon, nutmeg, paprika and black pepper, to taste. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Pour in the wine and cook over high heat for 1 minute. Stir in the diced tomatoes, sugar and beef broth. Reduce heat and simmer gently for about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>To make the béchamel sauce, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Whisk in the flour and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until golden. Slowly pour in the warm milk, whisking constantly. Cook over medium heat for about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the nutmeg. Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add some of the béchamel sauce to temper the eggs, then add them to the pan. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook about 2 minutes. Add more salt and pepper, if needed. Remove from the heat. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>To assemble, put half of the eggplant slices into an oiled 13x9-inch baking dish. Cover with the meat sauce. Top with the remaining eggplant. Pour the béchamel sauce over the top. Bake in a preheated 350-degree F oven for about 45 minutes. (If you want to top darker, broil it for a couple minutes. Do not walk away!) Let the casserole sit for at least 10 minutes before serving. </li>
    </ol>
